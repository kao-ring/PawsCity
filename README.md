# USER PROFILE

I’m so lonely. Covid, damn. I want a pet. And I’m new to pet owning. I need an app to locate a pet AND connection to the greater pet community.
Locally, it’s a challenge to find places to take my pet. Stores? Restaurants? Beauty parlors?
If I travel out of town to pick up my new furry companion, what about hotels? Restaurants along the way?
Although, I’m wishy-washy. And I want more info before I make such a big commitment, so I want access to more info about trainers, pet-care, city and local laws related to pets.
